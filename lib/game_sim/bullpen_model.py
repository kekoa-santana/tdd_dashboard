"""
Two-tier bullpen model for game simulation.

Replaces flat league-average bullpen rates with team-specific rates
split by leverage tier:
- High leverage (CL + SU): deployed in close games (|score_diff| <= 3)
- Low leverage (MR): deployed in blowouts

Builds TeamBullpenProfile from reliever role classification and
per-reliever season stats already in the system.
