    Parameters
    ----------
    pitcher_k_rate_samples : np.ndarray
        K% posterior samples from Layer 1.
    pitcher_bb_rate_samples : np.ndarray
        BB% posterior samples from Layer 1.
    pitcher_hr_rate_samples : np.ndarray
        HR/BF posterior samples from Layer 1.
    lineup_matchup_lifts : dict[str, np.ndarray]
        Per-stat matchup logit lifts. Keys: 'k', 'bb', 'hr'.
        Each value shape (9,) for 9 batting order slots.
    tto_lifts : dict[str, np.ndarray]
        TTO logit lifts. Keys: 'k', 'bb', 'hr'.
        Each value shape (3,) for TTO 1, 2, 3.
    pitcher_ppa_adj : float
        Pitcher pitches-per-PA adjustment.
    batter_ppa_adjs : np.ndarray
        Shape (9,) batter P/PA adjustments.
    exit_model : ExitModel
        Trained pitcher exit model.
    pitcher_avg_pitches : float
        Pitcher's historical average exit pitch count.
    babip_adj : float
        Pitcher BABIP adjustment for BIP outcomes.
    game_context : GameContext, optional
        Per-game environmental lifts (umpire, park, weather, catcher
        framing, pitcher form). Defaults to zero lifts.
    exit_calibration_offset : float
        Logit-scale offset for exit model probabilities. Negative values
        reduce exit probability (pitcher stays in longer).
    manager_pull_tendency : float
        Team's avg starter exit pitch count (manager proxy).
    mu_bf : float, optional
        Pitcher's shrinkage-estimated mean BF per start (from bf_model).
        When provided alongside sigma_bf, enables BF-anchored exit logic:
        target_bf is drawn per-sim from Normal(mu_bf, sigma_bf) and the
        exit decision only fires at inning boundaries, anchored to this
        target. This makes total BF sample-source-invariant (not affected
        by K/BB/HR posterior distribution changes). When None, falls back
        to the legacy per-PA exit model path (DEPRECATED — sensitive to
        K sample distribution, see exit model documentation).
    sigma_bf : float, optional
        Within-pitcher std of BF per start. Used with mu_bf.
    lineup_matchup_reliabilities : dict[str, np.ndarray], optional
        Per-stat reliability per batter slot. Keys: 'k', 'bb', 'hr'.
        Each value shape (9,), range [0, 1]. When provided, adds per-sim
        noise to matchup lifts: high reliability → tight, low → wide.
    bullpen_k_rate, bullpen_bb_rate, bullpen_hr_rate : float
        Opposing team's aggregate bullpen rates, used after the starter
        exits to complete the game to 27 outs. Defaults to league-average
        constants if team-specific rates are unavailable.
    n_sims : int
        Number of Monte Carlo simulations.
    random_seed : int
        For reproducibility.
